        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <img src="/gym/images/carbohy.jpg" class="nimg">
        <p>Firstly, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body and therefore play the most substantial role in fueling exercise. There are two different types of carbohydrates i.e. complex and simple. The names give an indication of the time taken to digest complex carbs that take a longer time period to digest than simple carbs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="prot">
        <h2>Protein</h2>
        <img src="/gym/images/prot.jpg" class="nimg">
        <p>Specifically, the majority of gym-goers will be well aware that consuming protein is important. Likewise, the reason why protein is so important is because it plays a key role in recovery and repair. A gym diet plan must include protein. During exercise, the body is exposed to strains and stresses. This cause damage to occur to the muscles at a microscopic level. So, in order to repair the damage, protein is needed. Without it, recovery periods will be extended and chronic fatigue may become a factor.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fat">
        <h2>Fats</h2>
        <img src="/gym/images/fat.jpg" class="nimg">
        <p>Fats are often incorrectly seen as the primary reason for fat gain. However, fats are not responsible for this and actually play a key role in the absorption and transport of nutrients. In addition, they can have a positive impact on heart health and hormone production.</p>

        <h1>Gym Diet - Pre-Workout Foods</h1>
        <img src="/gym/images/pre-work.jpg" class="nimg">
        <p>Focus on carbohydrates as all pre-workout meals or snacks to provide the body with energy to last the full session. So, if energy levels are sub-optimal, then performance will suffer and have a consequent impact on our rate of adaptation.</p>
        <p>Next, focus on simple carbohydrates in a gym diet plan as they take less time to digest and provide the body with energy. It may even be recommended to consume some simple carbs during a workout to maintain energy levels and performance.</p>
        <p>For example, <i><b>white bread, jam, granola, cereal, sports drinks, and fruit are all viable options for a pre-workout, energy-boosting snack.</b></i></p>
        <h1>Gym Diet - Post-Workout Foods</h1>
        <p>The purpose of post-workout nutrition is two-fold, firstly, to promote muscle recovery and secondly to replenish energy. Therefore, the focus should once again be on consuming good quality protein and carb foods.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, there is a widely held belief that protein timing is extremely important for maximizing growth. However, a number of recently based studies have indicated that total daily protein intake is of greater importance than the timing.</p>
        <p>Therefore, High-protein foods such as <i><b>lean beef, chicken, pork, turkey, eggs, dairy, seeds, quinoa, and nuts should be prioritized. Also, protein supplements, like protein shakes and bars,</b></i>can serve as a convenient tool for effectively boosting protein intake.</p>

    <p>On the whole, the above guide will prove to be useful, yet be aware that when it comes to nutrition, everyone is different. Not only will physical attributes determine your nutritional requirements, the goals that you have set will also influence your diet.</p>
    <p>Two goals that are extremely common are fat loss and muscle growth. So, in order to lose fat, calories must be restricted which will cause stored body fat to be broken down. On the other hand, as for muscle growth, calorie intake must be increased to build significant muscle size as additional calories are required to accelerate the recovery process. A gym diet plan must be a combination of micro and macro nutrients.</p>
    <h1>Foods to Avoid in Your Gym Diet Plan</h1>
    <img src="/gym/images/junk-food.jpg" class="nimg">
    <p>The following three foods should be avoided or limited as far as possible.</p>
    <p> Trans fats are a type of dietary fat that has consistently been shown to impact health. While trans fats do naturally occur in small quantities, artificial trans fats are notoriously hazardous. Artificial trans fats can be found in baked goods, fast food, and many snack foods.</p>
    <p>Similarly, many simple carbohydrate foods do not have great nutritional value and contain a high amount of sugar. While they may be useful for a short term energy boost, consuming a large number of simple carbs can be detrimental.</p>
    <p>Although technically not a food, alcohol is a substance that should also be limited as far as possible. Since there is much research to indicate that alcohol negatively impacts recovery and may even interfere with the muscle-building process, it might be good to stay away from it. So, it is not great to include it when you are detoxifying with your gym diet plan.</p>
